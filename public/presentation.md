Despite the exponential growth of DeFi, professional capital remains sidelined by three systemic failures:
*   **Liquidity Fragmentation:** Institutional capital stalled in low-depth pools.
*   **Operational Friction:** Legacy Web3 onboarding is slow and opaque.
*   **High-Impact Complexity:** Lack of unified, cross-margined interfaces.

## II. The Amerox Opportunity & Sizing
Amerox X targets the $2.2T crypto economy and $6Q global derivatives/P2P markets.
*   **$1.2T:** Annual DEX Volume TAM.

*   **150M+:** Institutional Users (2027E).

## III. The Enterprise Alpha: Why Amerox X Wins
Amerox X deliver a unified "Institutional Suite" with fintech simplicity:
*   **Unified Liquidity:** Cross-protocol routing.
